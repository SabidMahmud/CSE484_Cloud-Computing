1. Present these four key points.

- Problem definition: What are we doing?
- Motivation: Why are we doing this? (minimum 2 slides)
- Literature Review: What others have done on this particular Problem. (minimum 4 slides)
- Solution Approach: How we can do this (from a high level)? (minimum 2 slides)

2. Motivation part should contain these:
- Why is the problem important, or what are the applications of the solution?
- Why is this not covered by state-of-the art?
- Why cannot we develop the solution using state of the art approaches by making small changes

3. Literature review should address these things:
- Descrive the methodology of at least three related papers. (minimum 3 slides)
- state the pros and cons of each of the papers.
- How is our approach different from the others.
